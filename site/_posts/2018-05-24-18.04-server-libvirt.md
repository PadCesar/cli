In this post, I'll present how I deal with my virtual machines on a server an
access them remotely. 

## Setup - server side
In the post about the [network configuration](/server-18.04-network-bond.html),
a virtual bridge named *br0* has been configured, especially for the virtual
machines. A virtual machine connected to this brige will have a connection to
the network equivalent to the server connection, and will be seen by the network
as another machine on the same interface(s) as the server.

  - Install the required packages:
  ```console
cli@server:~$ sudo apt-get install libvirt-bin
```
  - Make sure your user is in the libvirt group:
  ```
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt cli
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt local
```
  - ubuntu [16.04](/tag/16.04.html) and [18.04](/tag/18.04.html) kernels have
nesting (running vm inside vm) enabled by default, for other distributions,
nesting can be enable like this test:
    ```conf
# If you have an Intel CPU, use this:
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/kvm_intel.conf
options kvm-intel nested=Y
# If you have an AMD CPU, then this:
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/kvm_amd.conf
options kvm-amd nested=1
```
### Virtual disks
  - A pool for storing virtual machines already exists in `/var/lib/libvirt/images`

  - Setup a pool for boot disks
  ```console
virsh pool-define-as boot --type dir --target /var/lib/libvirt/boot
virsh pool-autostart boot
virsh pool-start boot
```
  - Get some linux distributions to play with: 
    - An iso installer image for xubuntu 18.04
    - A ready to run image of openwrt (release lede-17.01)
  ```
sudo -i
cd /var/lib/libvirt/boot
wget http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-dvd/xubuntu/releases/18.04/release/xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso
chown libvirt-qemu:kvm xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso
cd ../images
https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/x86/64/lede-17.01.4-x86-64-combined-squashfs.img
chown libvirt-qemu:kvm lede-17.01.4-x86-64-combined-squashfs.img
exit
```
  - Since we have create a bridge for the virtual machines, we can safely
  disable the default network created by libvirt:
```
virsh net-autostart default --disable
virsh net-destroy default
virsh net-undefine default
```

### Disable snapshots for virtual disks
Snaphshotting multi-gigabyte virtual disk image is not a good idea, it ended up
filling my disks very fast, and since I don't have enough space on the SSD for
the virtual machines, let's move them to the HDDs.
  0. Stop libvirt
  ```console
   sudo systemctl stop libvirt-bin
```
  0. Create the subvolume and move data (if libvirt is already installed)
  ```console
   sudo -i
   mkdir -p /tmp/work/root /tmp/work/data
   mount /dev/mapper/root-root /tmp/work/root
   mount /dev/mapper/data-data /tmp/work/data
   cd /tmp/work
   btrfs subvolume create data/@var-lib-libvirt
   mv root/@/var/lib/libvirt/* data/@var-lib-libvirt/
   exit
```
  0. Add the required line to `/etc/fstab`:
  ```
/dev/mapper/data-data /var/lib/libvirt btrfs noatime,subvol=@var-lib-libvirt 0 2
```
  0. Mount and restart libvirt
  ```
sudo mount -a
sudo systemctl start libvirt-bin
```



## Setup - client side
  - Install the required packages:
  ```console
cli@workstation:~$ sudo apt-get install virt-manager
```
  - copy your ssh public key to the server
  ```console
cli@workstation:~$ ssh-copy-id cli@server
```
  - Start `virt-manager`, File > new connection...
    - Hypervisor : qemu/kvm
    - Connect to remote host : checked
    - username : cli
    - hostname : server
    - *Connect*

## Testing - client side - test the xubuntu image
  - Select the server connection
  - File > new virtual machine (or the new virtual machine button).
  - Step 1
    - Verify the connection selected is server one
    - Select Local media
    - *Forward*
  - Step 2
    - Select use ISO image and *browse...*, select boot/xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso then *Choose volume*
    - OS type : Linux
    - Version : Ubuntu 16.04
  	- *Forward*
  - Step 3
    - 1024 MB RAM and 1 CPU should be sufficient for testing
  	- *Forward*
  - Step 4
    - 15 Go should be sufficient for testing
  	- *Forward*
  - Step 5
    - Choose a name
    - Network selection : specify a shared device name:
      - *br0*
      âš  It seems there is a bug in [18.04](/tag/18.04.html),
      since the *br0* is listed when the server is running [16.04](/tag/16.04.html)
    - *Forward*
  - Now you can play with that new image

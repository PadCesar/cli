usb relay (ICSE013A)
Here is a small and inexpensive Linux friendly USB dual relay: ICStation ICSE013A, available on ebay for less than 5 USD.

![usb-relay](/data/img/usb-relay-icse013a.jpg)


Connectors:
 - USB micro-b
   - Used for power supply and USB-CDC
 - 4 pin header (not soldered) : 
   - Power + RS232 signals @ 3.3V
   - pinout:
     - RX (connect to master TX)
     - TX (connect to master RX)
     - GND
     - 5V (power supply)

Relay side:
 - 2x 3 screw terminal
   - NO
   - C
   - NC

Onboard devices:
  - 2x relay Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C
  - 1x USB to serial chip Prolific 2303HX
  - 1x probably a microcontroller  ??? ST78596


Serial configuration:
**9600,8,n,1**


Protocol:
Say hello and wait some time : 
 ```bash
 echo -n "P" > /dev/ttyUSB0 && sleep 0.5
 ```
Should reply 0xAD for dual channel


Say start and wait some time :
```bash
echo -n "Q" > /dev/ttyUSB0 && sleep 0.5)
```
Now the module wait for binary values until power is removed.

Set values (one bit per relay):
```bash
echo -n "\x01" > /dev/ttyUSB0 && sleep 0.5
```

This will also work using [openwrt](/tag/openwrt.html), using this driver:

```bash
opkg install kmod-usb-serial-pl2303
```

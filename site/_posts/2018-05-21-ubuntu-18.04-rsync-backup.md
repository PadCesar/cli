This is the second post about running ubuntu 18.04 on my server, if you look
at the [previous post](ubuntu-18.04-server-install-snapper.html), the server is
ready for use, with snapshot configured and almost nothing more.

So it's a good time to setup [backups](/tag/backup.html).

There are plenty of tools for backuping a [btrfs](/tag/btrfs.html) file system,
but let's do it the old way, using `rsync`.

## rsync - a complicated beast

`rsync` is so powerfull and so easy to mess with, that I have written a script
and a configuration for it, available on github
[here](https://github.com/RandomReaper/scripts/tree/master/backup).

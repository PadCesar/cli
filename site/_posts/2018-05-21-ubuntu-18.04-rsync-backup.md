This is the second post about running ubuntu 18.04 on my server, if you look
at the [previous post](ubuntu-18.04-server-install-snapper.html), the server is
ready for use, with snapshot configured and almost nothing more.

So it's a good time to setup [backups](/tag/backup.html).

There are plenty of tools for backuping a [btrfs](/tag/btrfs.html) file system,
but let's do it the old way, using `rsync`.

## rsync - a complicated beast

`rsync` is so powerfull and so easy to mess with, that I have written a
configurable script, available on github [here](https://github.com/RandomReaper/scripts/tree/master/backup){:.external}.

### `backup.sh`
I use [`backup.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomReaper/scripts/master/backup/backup.sh){:.external}
together with a configuration file to do my backups.
Here are some configuration sample files:
 - [to a local disk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomReaper/scripts/master/backup/backup.cfg.sample-local)
 - [to a remote (ssh) host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomReaper/scripts/master/backup/backup.cfg.sample-remote)

## Usage
```bash
usage: ./backup.sh [config_file] (or backup.cfg)
```
## Configuration file
Sample configuration files are documented, see [backup.cfg.sample-local](https://github.com/RandomReaper/scripts/blob/master/backup/backup.cfg.sample-local) and [backup.cfg.sample-remote](https://github.com/RandomReaper/scripts/blob/master/backup/backup.cfg.sample-remote)

Now that our server has a decent backup, let's [configure the network](server-18.04-network-bond.html).

It's possible to preview canon raw images (.cr2) in thunar :
```console
sudo apt-get install tumbler-plugins-extra
```
Then logoff and in again to make it work.

# Image viewer

Since I use [xfce](/tag/xfce.html), I tested `ristretto`, and it doesn't show
`.cr2` image, probably due to a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ristretto/+bug/1778695).

I tested `mirage`, but it does not automatically rotates images...

And now `nomacs` is my now favorite image viewer.


# Image mangagement
I use [`darktable`](https://www.darktable.org/){:.external}. for *developing* my
raw files.

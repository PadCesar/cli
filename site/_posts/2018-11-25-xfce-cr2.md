**This post is an updated version of [that one](/canon-raw-v1.html).**

It's possible to preview canon raw images (.cr2) in thunar :
```console
sudo apt-get install tumbler-plugins-extra
```
Then logoff and in again to make it work.

# Image viewer (for a quick review and erase)

Since I use [xfce](/tag/xfce.html), I tested `ristretto`, and it doesn't show
`.cr2` image, probably due to a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ristretto/+bug/1778695).

I tested `mirage`, but it does not automatically rotates images...

I tested `nomacs`, for some reason it does not preload the raw images (it takes
4 seconds to change to the next image).

And now I use `geequie`.


# Image mangagement
I use [`darktable`](https://www.darktable.org/){:.external}. for *developing* my
raw files.

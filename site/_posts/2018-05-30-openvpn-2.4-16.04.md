openvpn default cipher (BF-CBC) is vulnerable to the [SWEET32](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32){:.external}
attack, but since 2.4, openvpn is able to negotiate the cipher with the remote.

Sample `/var/log/syslog` extract:
```conf
May 29 18:40:19 X ovpn-X[X]: Data Channel Encrypt: Cipher 'BF-CBC' initialized with 128 bit key
May 29 18:40:19 X ovpn-X[X]: WARNING: this cipher's block size is less than 128 bit (64 bit).  Consider using a --cipher with a larger block size.
```

openvpn recommends changing the cipher using `--cipher`, but since I have some
legacy devices still connecting to my server, I won't change the server
configuration, only let the device select a better cipher.

The server runs on [openwrt - lede 17.01.4](/tag/openwrt.html), and is already
running openvpn 2.4.

Unfortunately, ubuntu [16.04](/tag/16.04.html) only provides [openvpn](/tag/openvpn.html) 2.3.
And here is how to upgrade the installation.

FIXME: Write a complete setup procedure for [18.04](/tag/18.04.html) including
certificate management.

## Upgrade
 - After a successful setup of openvpn 2.3 on 16.04, add this source to apt:
 ```shell
wget -O - https://swupdate.openvpn.net/repos/repo-public.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://build.openvpn.net/debian/openvpn/stable xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openvpn-aptrepo.list
```
 - Then update openvpn (it should restart automatically)
 ```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

This extract of `/var/log/syslog` will show the that this host is not
vulnerable anymore:
```shell
May 29 18:50:46 X ovpn-X[X]: Data Channel: using negotiated cipher 'AES-256-GCM'
May 29 18:50:46 X ovpn-X[X]: Outgoing Data Channel: Cipher 'AES-256-GCM' initialized with 256 bit key
May 29 18:50:46 X ovpn-X[X]: Incoming Data Channel: Cipher 'AES-256-GCM' initialized with 256 bit key
```
**Success!**

[syncthing](/tag/syncthing.html) is a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:.external}
decentralized file sync software, and is even available for most proprietary operating system.

Let's see how to install it as a systemd user service.

## Setup
0. Enable systemd service for the user running `syncthing`:
    
    ```console
    sudo loginctl enable-linger pim
    ```

0. Add the package (borrowed from [https://apt.syncthing.net/](https://apt.syncthing.net/){:.external}) :
    
    ```console
    # Add the release PGP keys:
    curl -s https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
    
    # Add the "stable" channel to your APT sources:
    echo "deb https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
    
    # Update and install syncthing:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install syncthing
    ```

0. Create the user service :
    
    ```console
    # make sure the systemd user directory exists
    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user

    # create the service file
    cat >~/.config/systemd/user/syncthing <<EOL
    [Unit]
    Description=Syncthing - Open Source Continuous File Synchronization
    Documentation=man:syncthing(1)

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing -no-browser -logflags=0
    Restart=on-failure
    SuccessExitStatus=3 4
    RestartForceExitStatus=3 4
    Nice=19
    IOSchedulingClass=idle

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    EOL
    ```

0. Enable and start the service
    ```
    systemctl --user enable syncthing
    systemctl --user start syncthing
    ```

## Web interface
The web interface is available at [http://localhost:8384](http://localhost:8384){:.external}{:.data-proofer-ignore}

## Listening ports
`syncthing` will work behind a NAT, but will use public relays. For faster operation,
have a look at [the syncthing documentation about firewalls](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/firewall.html){:.external}.

Many services I use have a web interface, so here is my *basic* [apache](/tag/apache.html)
setup. When I say *basic*, but I mean apache with https, [http/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2){:.external}, `mysql` and `phpmyadmin`...

## Needs

There are plenty of opensource webservers, but I've chosen [apache httpd](/tag/apache.html)
mainly for two reasons:
 * I know how to use it for years.
 * I even don't know how to pronounce [`nginx`](https://nginx.org/){:.external}.

### Services
On my home server, a web interface is available for:

| Service       | Description                         | Type            | Related tag
| -             | -                                   | -               |
| backuppc      | rsync based on disk backup          | web-app/perl    | -
| grafana       | data visualization and monitoring   | webserver       | [grafana](/tag/grafana.html)
| phpmyadmin    | web interface for mysql             | web-app/php     | [mysql](/tag/mysql.html)
| tvheadhend    | TV streaming and recording server   | webserver       | [tvheadend](/tag/tvheadend.html)
| weewx         | weather station software            | generated files | [weewx](/tag/weewx.html)
| zabbix        | network monitoring                  | web-app/php     | [zabbix](/tag/zabbix.html)

Apparently the grafana and tvheadend guys thinks it's a good idea to include a
webserver... Please don't, and here is why (IMHO):
 * The http/https ports are already used by another program.
 * There is already a lot of good opensource web servers, the time invested in
  your integrated web server could have been better spent.
 * A person that is able to setup grafana or tvheadend, is clearly able to install
 a webserver. Please have a look at phpmyadmin, it's so easy to setup on apache.

### https, http2, php, ...
For performance reasons I want to enable [http2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2){:.external},
and this will affect which apache mpm to install.

# Install

```
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server php7.2-fpm phpmyadmin automysqlbackup 
```
 - Http server : apache2
 - Configuring phpmyadmin : Yes
 - Password for phpmyadmin : *empty*

mysql use system password for root, but root has no password, so let's use mysql
password for root:
```
sudo mysql -u root mysql
UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
SET PASSWORD FOR root@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyCoolPassword');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```

# Configure apache2

## Get rid of http

The [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){:.external} site provides valid
SSL certificates for web servers. I don't want to write a post about that today,
but at some point in the procedure, you must prove that you are running the
server you want a certificate for, and the simplest challenge (`HTTP-01`) uses
plain http for the transport.

So I would like to disable port 80, but it's currently impossible since I want
to use let's encrypt certbot...

Redirecting all traffic from http to https may let me do stupid things, for
instance forgetting the **s** from **https** and POSTing some critical data over
unencrypted http, so my compromise is to redirect only the URL used in the
`HTTP-01` to https, and respond to other http URL with a ***`403 Forbidden`***
error code.

Here is the the changes to be done in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf` to enable
`http2`, and disable http unless for let's encrypt:

```
		<VirtualHost *:80>
                <Location />
                    Order deny,allow
                    Deny from all
                </Location>
                Redirect /.well-known/acme-challenge/ https://YOUR_SERVER_NAME_HERE/.well-known/acme-challenge/
        </VirtualHost>

        <VirtualHost _default_:443>
                Protocols h2 http/1.1
                ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

                DocumentRoot /var/www/html
...
```

## Setup apache modules
```
sudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif
sudo a2enconf php7.2-fpm
sudo a2dismod mpm_prefork 
sudo a2enmod mpm_event 
sudo a2enmod http2
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf 
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

# Testing
Open this URL in your favorite browser : https://YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE/phpmyadmin,
then login a `root`/`MyCoolPassword`.

# `mysql` backups
You may have noticed that `automysqlbackup` is installed. It will periodically
backup all mysql databases into `/var/lib/automysqlbackup`.

It is configurable by modifying `/etc/default/automysqlbackup`.

Here is some recommendations extracted from the `automysqlbackup` script:

```
# Daily Backups are rotated weekly..
# Weekly Backups are run by default on Saturday Morning when
# cron.daily scripts are run...Can be changed with DOWEEKLY setting..
# Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle..
# Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month..
# Monthly Backups are NOT rotated automatically...
# It may be a good idea to copy Monthly backups offline or to another
```

# To be continued
Now that the infrastructure is in place, let's do something with it : [monitor system health](server-18.04-zabbix-grafana.html).

Our system is running well, RAID is running [fine](/server-18.04-playing-with-raid.html),
backup are [fine](/server-18.04-backup-rsync.html), and our server can send
[email alerts](/18.04-server-sendmail.html).

Hard disk failure may not be predicted reliably (see this [article published by google](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub32774){:.external}), it may be interesting to keep an eye on HDD.

## S.M.A.R.T.
Most HDDs (and SSDs) implements the [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.)
monitoring system. This system logs informations into some non-volatile memory in
the disk, and can be queried usint `smartctl`.

### Setup
```console
sudo apt-get install smartmontools
```

I won't explain every fields in the output of `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc`, but
here are some interesting attributes [see description here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes).

### Load_Cycle_Count

This one should be watched because this number is limited (around 50'000 for a
standard desktop drive, or 300'000 for a laptop hard drive). It's clearly
possible to kill a drive just by letting it go to low power and restart it soon
after (search for "WD Green Load_Cycle_Count" in your favorite search engine!).

```console
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc | grep Load_Cycle_Count
193 Load_Cycle_Count        0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -       205
```

### Power_On_Hours
```console
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc | grep Load_Cycle_Count
  9 Power_On_Hours          0x0032   079   079   000    Old_age   Always       -       15818
```
It seems that my HDD is running for almost 2 years!

### Reallocated_Sector_Ct and Reallocated_Event_Count

```console
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc | grep -E 'Reallocated_Sector_Ct|Reallocated_Event_Count'
  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   200   200   140    Pre-fail  Always       -       0
196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always       -       0
```
Seems the disk a no surface problems ;)

### For SSD: Wear_Leveling_Count and Reallocated_Event_Count

```console
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep -E 'Wear_Leveling_Count|Total_LBAs_Written'
177 Wear_Leveling_Count     0x0013   091   091   000    Pre-fail  Always       -       179
241 Total_LBAs_Written      0x0032   099   099   000    Old_age   Always       -       30052738530
```

According to [this online calculator](https://www.virten.net/2016/12/ssd-total-bytes-written-calculator/){:.external},
I have already written 13.99 TB, and the estimated wear level is 91% (Wear_Leveling_Count value). Or
it should be called *health level* since at 100% it has no wear, and should be
dead at 0%.

## hddtemp
As you have seen in the output of `smartctl`, most HDD have temperature sensors,
and this information can be accessed using `hddtemp`.

Setup:
```console
sudo apt-get install hddtemp
```

Use:
```console
hddtemp /dev/sd{c,d,e,f}
/dev/sdc: WDC WD20EFRX-68EUZN0: 29째C
/dev/sdd: WDC WD20EFRX-68EUZN0: 29째C
/dev/sde: WDC WD20EFRX-68EUZN0: 29째C
/dev/sdf: WDC WD20EFRX-68EUZN0: 29째C
```

Some disk will fail (example this ssd:)
```console
hddtemp /dev/sda
WARNING: Drive /dev/sda doesn't seem to have a temperature sensor.
WARNING: This doesn't mean it hasn't got one.
WARNING: If you are sure it has one, please contact me (hddtemp@guzu.net).
WARNING: See --help, --debug and --drivebase options.
/dev/sda: Samsung SSD 850 EVO 120G B              :  no sensor
```

Another failing example (external USB disk)
```console
hddtemp /dev/sdg
/dev/sdg: Seagate Expansion:  drive supported, but it doesn't have a temperature sensor.
```

# Monitoring
Both `smartmontools` and `hddtemp` can be configured to periodicaly watch the
HDDs health, see `/etc/default/smartmontools` and `/etc/default/hddtemp`.

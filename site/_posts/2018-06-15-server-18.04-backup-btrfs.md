While writing the previous posts, I ***lied***. Backup are OK at home, but not
on my virtual server that I use for writing this blog.

So while [growing my RAID](/server-18.04-growing-raid-lvm.html), I removed one
disk from the array using `mdadm` and I physically removed the other. That one
that was expected to stay in the array...

So I had a look at all my post about the [server](/tag/server.html) and I have
redone the full install.

# Tools
[snapsync](https://github.com/doudou/snapsync) seems to be especially
designed for snapper, so let's test it.

```console
sudo apt-get install bundler
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doudou/snapsync/master/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

## First backup
Take an empty disk, then create one partition on it:
```console
sudo apt-get install gdisk
sudo sgdisk -Z /dev/vdg
sudo sgdisk -p /dev/vdg
sudo sgdisk -n1 /dev/vdg
```
Create a btrfs filessytem on it : 
```console
sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/vdg1
```

Mount it:
```console
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup
sudo mount /dev/vdg1 /mnt/backup -o noatime
```

Initialize backup for all snapper targets:

```console
/opt/snapsync/bin/snapsync init /mnt/backup/
```

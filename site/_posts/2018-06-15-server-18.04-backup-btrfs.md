While writing the previous posts, I ***lied***. Backup are OK at home, but not
on my virtual server that I use for writing this blog.

So while [growing my RAID](/server-18.04-growing-raid-lvm.html), I removed one
disk from the array using `mdadm` and I physically removed the other. That one
that was expected to stay in the array...

So I had a look at all my post about the [server](/tag/server.html) and I have
redone the full install.

# `snapper` and how to deal with problems

## `snapper undochanges` for small problems

Let's suppose you've updated a package, and the new version does not work
anymore. `apt` should have triggered a snapshot, and thoses changes can be
reverted.

I don't have a situation like this on my system, but let's pretend I have one,
by installing a software, for instance `ncdu`. It's a bad example, since `ncdu`
is really usefull, but let's do it:

0. Create a ~fake~ problem
   ```bash
sudo apt-get install -y ncdu
```
0. Identify the snapshots
   ```
snapper list

single | 255 |       | Tue 15 May 2018 07:00:09 PM CEST | root | timeline | timeline    |         
pre    | 256 |       | Thu 17 May 2018 08:24:12 PM CEST | root | number   | apt         |         
post   | 257 | 256   | Thu 17 May 2018 08:24:19 PM CEST | root | number   | apt         |     
```
	`apt` has created a pre/post snapshots with numbers **257** and **256**
0. Revert the changes
   ```bash
sudo snapper undochange 256..257
create:0 modify:6 delete:96
```
`ncdu` is not installed anymore, **success!**

## ⚠ `snapper rollback` for bigger problems ⚠

`snapper rollback` is **not supported** on [ubuntu](/tag/ubuntu.html), mainly
because SUSE Linux (the main contributor of `snapper`) uses a different 
filesystem layout.

However, since we've got snapshots, we can still recover manually from
catastrophic failures.

0. Make sure you've got a bootable media for your machine.
0. Make sure you've got a recent [backup](/pages/backup.html).
0. **NO, liten to me NOW!**, make really really sure you've got a working backup
and and a working bootable media for your machine, **always**.
0. Make sure you've got a good snapshot of your system, and `/bin` is on the
snapshot
   ```bash
sudo touch /bin/test_today
snapper create -c timeline -d "about to destroy the system"
snapper list

snapper status 261..262

```
0. Now I'm sure `/bin` is in my snapshots, let's create a ~~fake~~ problem:
0. Create a ~~fake~~ problem.
   ```bash
sudo rm /bin/bash
```
0. Now reboot, (you won't be able to login since bash is your default shell)
0. Reboot on your bootable media, select ***Rescue a broken system***
0. Do as you do when you installed the system
0. Assemble the RAID array (automatic will do), then select your root device,
mine is `/dev/root/root`
0. Execute a shell in the installer environment
0. Umount `/target` it is mounted with a wrong subvolume argument, and remount
it
   ```
   umount /target
   mount /dev/root/root /target
```
0. Make a snapshot of the broken system
```
btrfs create subvolume snapshot -r /target/@ /target/@/.snapshots/broken
```
0. Restore
```
btrfs mv /target/@ /target/@_broken
btrfs subvolume snapshot /target/@_broken/.snapshots/261/snapshot /target/@
mv /target/@_broken/.snapshots /target/@
umount /target
sync
```
0. reboot (should work), then let's have a look at `snapper`
```
snapper create -c timeline -d "system restored"
snapper list

A server should be able to send email alerts, just in case some service like
*cron*, *mdadm* or smartmontools detect a failure.

## Here is the simplest configuration
The simplest way to let a server send emails is by using `ssmtp`, here is a
sample configuration for it, using an external SMTP server.

This configuration supposes you've got a stmp username, servername, password,
and email for sending mails plus an email for receiving emails for instance:
 - recipent: your_email@yourisp.com
 - hostname: output of `hostname -f`, for instance server-home.example.org
 - sender server:mail.example.com
 - sender user:abcd (may be the same or different as the sender email)
 - sender email:abcd@example.com, the part after the @ goes to `rewriteDomain`
 - sender passwd:beith6Ei

## Edit `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`
```
#
# Config file for sSMTP sendmail
#
# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=your_email@yourisp.com

# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required no 
# MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
mailhub=mail.example.com

# Where will the mail seem to come from?
rewriteDomain=example.com
# The full hostname
hostname=server-home.example.org

# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?
# YES - Allow the user to specify their own From: address
# NO - Use the system generated From: address
FromLineOverride=NO
# Use SSL/TLS before starting negotiation
UseTLS=Yes
UseSTARTTLS=Yes

# Username/Password
AuthUser=abcd
AuthPass=beith6Ei

FromLineOverride=no
```
and `/etc/ssmtp/revaliases`
```
# sSMTP aliases
# 
# Format: local_account:outgoing_address:mailhub
#
# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]
# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.

root:abcd@example.com
www-data:abcd@example.com

You may have noticed that I sometimes writes some words in UPPERCASE, not because
I'm angry, but because there is a [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments){:.external}
about that subject.

I SHOULD have included this notice from [RFC 1129](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119){:.external}:

>     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
>     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
>     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
>     RFC 2119.

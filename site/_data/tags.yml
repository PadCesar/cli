  [openwrt](https://openwrt.org){:.external} is an open source firmware, mainly used on routers.

  Since I discovered it, I only buy routers and wifi access point compatible with it.
  Currently running at home on:
   - my router : [PC Engines APU2](https://www.pcengines.ch/apu2.htm){:.external}.
   - my wifi access points : [Linksys WRT3200ACM and WRT1900ACS](https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/linksys/wrt_ac_series){:.external}.
